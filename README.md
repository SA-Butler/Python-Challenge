# Python-Challenge

This Python-Challenge folder contains 2 directories namely PyBank and PyPoll. Each contains a python script called main.py. 
In the Pybank folder the script processes data from a csv file (budget_.csv) and analyses according to the instruction. The output is sent to the terminal screen. 
For the PyPoll the script analyses the supplied csv containing voting ballots and candidates. The script is written for this particlar file and dataset but could be adapted for future voting when parameters are known. In addition to screen output the results are also written to a results file namely results.csv in an "analysis" subdirectory.
